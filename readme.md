# KanbanBoard

This project implements a simple Kanban Board application for managing tasks and their progress. The application allows users to create tasks, move them between different stages (ToDo, In Progress, Completed), and track their progress.

## Datastructures

      TodoList: {list:[{ListName:"List1":cardlist:[
{
TaskName:"Task-1",
description:"",
Activity:"",
Prority:"",
Assign:"",

        }
    ]
    }, {ListName:"List2",
        cardlist:[
        {
            TaskName:"Task-2",
            description:"",
            Activity:"",
            Prority:"",
            Assign:"",

        }
    ]
    }
    ]

}
